LANDLORD STUDIOS – LANDLORDS WITH SWORDS

Landlords with Swords is a tile-based game about taking land. Competitive in nature, up to 4 players square off in a dungeon and use their sword and their wits to dominate the map by game’s end. Winning is enabled through three means: resources, gear, and bonuses. Resources are secured by controlling tiles and killing other players and mobs. Gear can either be purchased with resources or found by players in the dangerous wilderness. Bonuses are strategic purchases that temporarily augment a player’s strength. The player who makes best use of their resources, collects the best gear, and effectively purchases bonuses will be in a position to conquer the map by the end of the game.
